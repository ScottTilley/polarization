USA 149 (DSP satellite)

Here's a brief analysis of the results.  DSPs are known to rotate at 6 RPM.  The data was obtain by sampling every second with an orthogonal feed system on a 1.8m dish antenna and X and Y where processed in Gnuradio as the scrpt attached shows.  The Stokes parameters and other post analysis is done in the Jupyter-notebook in the folder.

By examining the Stokes parameter plot one can determine the spacecraft is indeed rotating at 6 RPM.
